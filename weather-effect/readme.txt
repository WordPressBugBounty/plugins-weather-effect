Add animated falling effects like snow, rain, autumn leaves, and seasonal decorations to your website.

== Description ==

Weather Effect lets you add animated falling objects to your website. You can display snowfall during winter, falling leaves in autumn, rain drops, or festive decorations for holidays like Christmas, Halloween, and Valentine's Day.

The plugin works by overlaying animated elements on your pages. Visitors see these effects as they browse your site, which can help create a seasonal atmosphere or celebrate special occasions.
